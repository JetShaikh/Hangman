### To do (Whose Doing What)
- Erika : User Input & Output _ test run for all the code - is it working?

- Miriam : Images (CCS)- Animation (Hangman) Apper after one another when the number guess certain number then number of certain bodies              shows

- Nuz(a)hat : Dictionary & test words _ Code for translation of the image to one certain image to another like head to head                             and body for the image transltion, put in each part so that each is a serpreate image? So that each has a differnet function               and that all dont do thesame function assigned for only one body part. Like appering at a certain time, when other is                     supposed to (body appering with head- when only head suppoused to apper)

- All : Connecting everything together

Done : - Counting each letter
       - Code for serching through word looking for certain letter - using Booleans 
       - Spells the word out induvidually 
       - Counts letters in var word, use the blank spaces
       - Display the word inside the text box
       - Chooses random word 
       - Setting var word (Bread in this case)
       
Needs to be done:
       - Make it choose a word randomly from dictionary
       - Then split, word check, see if user inpout is correct
       - Connect with hangman dude that appears out of nowhere (Miriam)
       - Number of guesses variable (10?)
       
Extra
       - If user guesses wrong letter, can't repeat letter
       - Missed letter bank
       
Right now
       - Need to make it so that the guesses itr set and gets lower but does not restart- loops and arrays for this
       - the guesses should be looped and the letters too, so that the word can actully be completed and not restarted the whole time :          so if you guess a that letter would stay there, and then you guess b that would show with the a. not just the b showing.                (loops.)
